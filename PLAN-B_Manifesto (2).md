# PLAN-B Manifesto: Computation Where Intelligence Does Not Imply Power

PLAN-B exists because the cost of reverse engineering and behavioral cloning is collapsing.
As intelligence (human or artificial) increases, systems that rely on secrecy of code or obscurity of implementation become fragile.

## Our principle
**A system should remain safe even if the adversary fully understands it.**

Therefore, PLAN-B focuses on:
- **Threshold authority** (K-of-N) for execution and version activation
- **Secret sharing** for critical parameters
- **Oracle governance** (budgets, rate limits, audit) to make cloning expensive and detectable
- **Transparent threat modeling** rather than security-through-obscurity

## What PLAN-B is for
- Protecting legitimate IP and decision functions from automated extraction
- Reducing the risk of misuse by powerful autonomous agents
- Building infrastructure where “knowing” does not automatically grant “doing”

## What PLAN-B is not for
- Hiding malware
- Evading audits or compliance
- Preventing legitimate security research

We welcome critique, experiments, and proofs—because durable security improves in the open.
